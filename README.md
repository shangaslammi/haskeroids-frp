## Haskeroids-FRP

This is a version of [Haskeroids](https://github.com/shangaslammi/haskeroids) modified to use the [coroutine-frp](https://github.com/shangaslammi/coroutine-frp) AFRP library for its game logic. The aim is to compare the implementation effort and performance of game logic based on reactive arrows and a traditional model using the State monad.

The conversion to AFRP is still a work in progress.
